        <div class="section-title">Dosage Adjustments</div>
        <p><strong>Coadministration with ibuprofen:</strong> Prolong the dosing interval by 10 hours when ibuprofen is administered.</p>
        <p><strong>Hypothermia/Asphyxia:</strong> Dose interval was prolonged by 10 hours in neonates with asphyxia in a pharmacokinetic study. Alternatively, dose adjustment was suggested based on a population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation of retrospectively collected data for near term neonates with perinatal asphyxia treated with therapeutic hypothermia (n=56) combined with published data of preterm and term neonates (n=874). Proposed regimen: 15 mg/kg/dose every 48 h for children between 1,200 g and 2,800 g and 15 mg/kg/ dose every 42 h for neonate above 2,800 g for the first 2 consecutive doses during hypothermia (33.5 degrees C) for target concentrations greater than 24 mg/L for peak and less than 5 mg/L for trough. Less than 17% of dose simulations had trough concentrations more than 5 mg/L </p>
        <p><strong>Renal Impairment:</strong> Either prolong intervals or reduce dose.</p>

        <p>Amikacin was effective for infections caused by gram-negative bacilli that are resistant to other aminoglycosides. Usually used in combination with a B-lactam antibiotic for neonatal sepsis and other severe infections because of the possibility of infections due to gram-positive organisms such as streptococci or pneumococci</p>

    <div class="section-title">Sepsis</div>
        <p>Optimal treatment for suspected, early-onset sepsis is broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage
using a combination of ampicillin and an aminoglycoside (usually gentamicin); once a
pathogen is identified, therapy should be narrowed unless synergism is required. Therapy
should be discontinued at 48 hours if the probability of sepsis is low. Duration of treatment is
usually 10 days for bacteremia without an identifiable focus.

There was no difference in failure rate between a 7-day vs 10-day duration of empiric
treatment with IV cefTRIAXone and amikacin for culture-proven sepsis in 132 neonates, 1.5
kg or more and gestational age 32 weeks or more, who remitted clinically by day 5 ina
randomized study. The follow-up period was 28 days. The median age at presentation was 3
days (2 to 4 days) and 56.8% had early-onset sepsis. The majority of organisms in blood
cultures were K/ebsiella spp. (40.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (22.7%), Enterobacter spp.
(16.7%), and MRSA (7.6%).</p>

        <p>Dilute to a final concentration of 2.5 to 10 mg/mL [8][9][10][11] and administer as IV
infusion by syringe pump over 60 to 120 minutes; in neonatal studies amikacin was
infused over 20 minutes and in neonatal pharmacokinetic modeling studies infusion rates
of 20 to 30 minutes were applied.

Administer as a separate infusion from penicillin-containing compounds. IM injection is associated with variable absorption, especially in the very small infant.</p>

        <p><strong>Administration:</strong> In vitro mixing of aminoglycosides with beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillin
or cephalosporins) may result in a significant mutual inactivation. A reduction in serum half-
life or serum level may occur when an aminoglycoside or penicillin-type drug is administered
by separate routes. Inactivation of the aminoglycoside is clinically significant only in patients
with severely impaired renal function. Inactivation may continue in specimens of body fluids
collected for assay, resulting in inaccurate aminoglycoside readings. Such specimens should
be properly handled (assayed promptly, frozen or treated with betalactamase)

<div class="section-title">Adverse Effects</div>
        <p>Transient and reversible renal tubular dysfunction may occur, resulting in increased urinary
losses of sodium, calcium, and magnesium. Vestibular and auditory ototoxicity may occur.
The addition of other nephrotoxic and/or ototoxic medications (eg, furosemide, vancomycin) may increase these adverse effects. Increased neuromuscular blockade (ie, neuromuscular weakness and respiratory failure) may occur when used with pancuronium or other
neuromuscular blocking agents and in patients with hypermagnesemia.</p>
<hr>
<div class="section-title">Black Box Warning</div>
        <p>•Patients treated with parenteral aminoglycosides should be under close clinical observation
because of the potential ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity associated with their use. Safety for
treatment periods which are longer than 14 days has not been established.
•Neurotoxicity, manifested as vestibular and permanent bilateral auditory ototoxicity, can
occur in patients with preexisting renal damage and in patients with normal renal function
treated at higher doses and/or for periods longer than those recommended. The risk of
aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity is greater in patients with renal damage. High frequency
deafness usually occurs first and can be detected only by audiometric testing. Vertigo may
occur and may be evidence of vestibular injury. Other manifestations of neurotoxicity may include numbness, skin tingling, muscle twitching and convulsions . The risk of hearing loss
due to aminoglycosides increases with the degree of exposure to either high peak or high
trough serum concentrations . Patients developing cochlear damage may not have symptoms
during therapy to warn them of developing eighth-nerve toxicity, and total or partial
irreversible bilateral deafness may occur after the drug has been discontinued.
Aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity is usually irreversible.
•Aminoglycosides are potentially nephrotoxic. The risk of nephrotoxicity is greater in patients
with impaired renal function and in those who receive high doses or prolonged therapy.
•Neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis have been reported following parenteral
injection, topical instillation (as in orthopedic and abdominal irrigation or in local treatment of
empyema), and following oral use of aminoglycosides. The possibility of these phenomena
should be considered if aminoglycosides are administered by any route, especially in patients
receiving anesthetics; neuromuscular blocking agents such as tubocurarine, succinylcholine,
decamethonium; or in patients receiving massive transfusions of citrate-anticoagulated blood.
If blockage occurs, calcium salts may reverse these phenomena, but mechanical respiratory
assistance may be necessary.
•Renal and eighth-nerve function should be closely monitored especially in patients with
known or suspected renal impairment at the onset of therapy and also in those whose renal
function is initially normal but who develop signs of renal dysfunction during therapy. Serum
concentrations of amikacin should be monitored when feasible to assure adequate levels and
to avoid potentially toxic levels and prolonged peak concentrations above 35 micrograms per
mL. Urine should be examined for decreased specific gravity, increased excretion of proteins
and the presence of cells or casts . Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine or creatinine
clearance should be measured periodically. Serial audiograms should be obtained where
feasible in patients old enough to be tested, particularly high risk patients . Evidence of
ototoxicity (dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus , roaring in the ears and hearing loss) or nephrotoxicity
requires discontinuation of the drug or dosage adjustment.
•Concurrent and/or sequential systemic, oral or topical use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic
products, particularly bacitracin, cisplatin, amphotericin B, cephaloridine, paromomycin,
viomycin, polymyxin B, colistin, vancomycin, or other aminoglycosides should be avoided.
Other factors that may increase risk of toxicity are advanced age and dehydration.
•The concurrent use of amikacin with potent diuretics (ethacrynic acid or furosemide) should
be avoided since diuretics by themselves may cause ototoxicity. In addition, when
administered intravenously, diuretics may enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering
antibiotic concentrations in serum and tissue.</p>
